# Auth0 Ionic 3: Login

This sample application contains an Ionic 3 starter app with Auth0 login.

> **Note:** It is advised that you begin with a clean starter app from scratch and follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ionic3/01-login) to get set up and running quickly and painlessly. Ionic / Cordova are sensitive to remnants being left behind by plugins and platforms being added, altered, or removed, so the most stable method of development is to start from a clean slate.

To work with the cloned sample app, follow the instructions below.

## Dependencies

You should have the appropriate **native application development tools** set up on your local machine. If you don't own devices, you can use emulators. For **iOS**, you should install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (free) and for **Android**, install [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and an emulator of your choice, such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) (free) or better yet, [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) (paid, with free trial option).

> **Note:** If using an emulator, make sure you also have a browser installed on the emulated device. In the case of Android, this may require the Google Play Store. See your emulator's documentation for details.

## Clone the Repo

Clone this repo to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ionic3-samples.git
```

Once the repo is downloaded, navigate into the appropriate sample folder in your local filesystem, such as `01-Login` (this folder). From the correct folder, install the sample app's dependencies:

```bash
$ cd auth0-ionic3-samples/01-Login
$ npm install
```

## Auth0 Setup

1.  Sign up for [a free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup).
2.  Log into your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
3.  Navigate to the [Clients](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients) section in the sidebar and create a new client by clicking the **+ Create Client** button.
4.  Give your app a name, such as "Ionic 3 Auth0 App", and select `Native` as the client type. Click the **Create** button.
5.  Make note of the **Domain** and **Client ID**. You will need these for the Ionic app's auth configuration.
6.  In **Allowed Callback URLs**, add: `com.auth0.ionic://{your_Auth0_domain}/cordova/com.auth0.ionic/callback` and replace `{your_Auth0_domain}` with the **Domain** identifier.

> **Note:** You will add the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** shortly, after you `run` the app. Allowed navigation addresses will be automatically generated in the project's `config.xml` and you will then add them to your Auth0 configuration.

## Run the App

You will now need to allow Ionic / Cordova to install the necessary plugins and update your `config.xml` appropriately for the platform you wish to run on.

Use the following commands to run the app on your desired platform(s) (e.g., `ios` or `android`):

```bash
# Run on desired platform (e.g., ios or android)
$ npm run ionic:{platform}
```

This will then launch your app in the local emulation environment for the platform you chose (Xcode Simulator for iOS or the Android emulator of your choice).

> **Note:** Don't be alarmed if you _cannot authenticate_ successfully yet at this stage! There was some configuration generated by running the app that you still need to add to your Auth0 settings.

## Update Auth0 Dashboard Configuration

1.  After executing the `run` command, your `config.xml` file should contain `<allow-navigation>` tag(s).
2.  Make note of IP address URLs from any `<allow-navigation>` tags.
3.  Log into your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) and go to your Ionic app client's **Settings**.
4.  Add the full allowed navigation addresses (including `http://` and ports) to the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** settings for your Auth0 client and click the **Save Changes** button.

You should now be able to log into your app!
